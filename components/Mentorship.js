            <p className="py-[0.3rem]">
              Mentorship in middle and high school has the power to impact the
              course of students’ academic and personal life trajectories. Human
              connection built on trust is the glue that binds students’
              academic and personal lives and helps them make sense of their
              futures.
            </p>
            <p className="py-[0.3rem]">
              The transition from high school to college is a big leap towards
              the goals we aspire to achieve. It is also a crucial period for
              exploring the various opportunities available to us. Today, there
              are so many diversion fields like Artificial Intelligence, Machine
              Learning, Game Development, etc. Talking to someone who was once
              in the same boat and went through the same phase as you are, can
              help you understand what mistakes you must refrain from making and
              also learn from her/his experience.

            </span>
            <p className="text-lg">
              When you have a mentor, they not only provide you the guidance
              also share their personal experiences and learnings with you. They
              will let you in, about the learnings of other people. This helps
              you build your own perspective and gain a clear understanding of
              how things are done and how they could be.

              They empathise with you
            </span>
            <p className="text-lg">
              A mentor has been through similar times and they understand how
              things proceed in the real world in a given field. They can look
              at things from your point of view and suggest the best ways of
              dealing with a situation when you are stuck. A mentor can provide
              a student with personal support throughout the ups and downs of
              academia. This can reinforce a student’s sense of resilience.

            <p className="text-lg">
              Mentors also let you in on their network and help you connect with
              the right kind of people in your journey. This helps you interact
              with more people in your industry and also opens up endless
              opportunities for you. When you talk with experienced people, it
              always helps you learn things faster.

            <p className="text-lg">
              Everyone’s journey is different, but they always want to reach the
              end goal. Your mentor will help you remember “the Why” of your
              journey which will help you set various goals and milestones for
              your journey. This will also help you when you have to make some
              tough decisions in your career.

              It is easy to get distracted and go off track. When you have a
              mentor, they not only help you in setting the goals but they also
              check in with you on your progress. Now that you have someone to
              hold you accountable, you easily become more motivated to finish
              the tasks for yourself and see the results.
